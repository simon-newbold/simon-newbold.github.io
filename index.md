title: 👋 Hi, I'm Simon Newbold – Principal Data Engineer (Migration/Archiving)
---
This page is a bit of a guide to working with me — part intro, part cheat sheet. Whether we’re collaborating for the first time or deep in the data trenches together, I hope this helps us connect better. I believe in openness, clarity, and a good dose of humour.

## 🧭 About Me
I’m a Principal Data Engineer based in Nottingham, passionate about reducing complexity, increasing productivity and automation of repetitive and boring tasks. I live with my wife Claire, twin girls and our two slightly chaotic Golden Retrievers; Link & Mac. Outside of work, I’m a big Ice Hockey fan supporting the Nottingham Panthers ⚫🟡 and in the NHL World Minnesota Wild, Boston Bruins & Seattle Kraken. I also enjoy taking part in CTF and other hacky games and activities - though I have less time now i'm a father then I used to! I am a Linux 🐧 User always happy to chat distros and pretty much Apple 🍎 user for everything else 

My work history includes many years spent wrangling data, infrastructure & platforms, and cyber security for mostly companies associated with healthcare in one way or another. I care deeply about data quality, automation, securtity and making life easier for analysts, engineers, and everyone in between.

📡 Communication Style
- 🕰️ Working hours: I’m usually online 07:45–16:15, Monday to Friday.
- 💬 Best way to reach me: Teams chat or a quick call. I check email, but it’s not my go-to.
- 📅 Meetings: I prefer short, focused sessions with a clear agenda. Bonus points for diagrams.
- 🧘‍♂️ Boundaries: If I message outside your hours, no pressure to reply until you’re back. I respect your time and hope you’ll do the same.

🧠 Neurodiversity & Me
I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, which means my brain likes to take the scenic route sometimes — full of curiosity, energy, and occasional tangents. It’s part of what makes me a creative problem-solver and a relentless optimiser.
I’ve learned how to work with it, not against it:
• 	I thrive with structure, clear goals, and visual thinking.
• 	I’m great at spotting patterns and connecting dots others might miss.
• 	I sometimes need to manage distractions, so I use tools and routines that help me stay focused.
• 	If I seem to be fidgeting or doing something else in meetings I am either taking notes 📝 or keeping myself focused.
If you notice me hyper-fixating on a problem or bouncing between ideas — that’s just my brain doing its thing. I welcome open conversations about how we can collaborate best.

🧩 What I Do
My role is all about helping to build a framework for data migration and archiving. I design and build data platforms that scale, support data governance, and help teams unlock the value of their data.
Current focus areas:
- Data migration architecture – cloud-native, modular, and built for change
- Data migration and archiving tooling - tools to help with data mapping, processing, movement & housekeeping
- ETL/ELT pipelines – robust, observable, and low-maintenance
- Metadata & lineage – because knowing where your data came from matters
- Collaboration – working with analysts, scientists, and engineers to make data usable

🧭 How I Work
- I ask “why?” a lot — not to be difficult, but to make sure we’re solving the right problem.
- I prefer early drafts over polished perfection. Let’s iterate together.
- I love a good whiteboard session, even if it’s virtual.
- I communicate best with visuals, analogies, and real-world examples.
- I’m structured in my thinking but flexible in my approach.

🧠 Decision-Making Style
I lean on data, context, and gut instinct — in that order. I’ll usually ask:
- Is this maintainable long-term?
- Is it as automated, cost effective, reusable and secure as it can be?
- Does it align with our goals?
- Who’s impacted, and have we included them?
I aim for consensus but won’t shy away from making a call when needed.

🔄 Feedback Philosophy
- I give feedback to help, not to criticise.
- I’ll praise publicly and critique privately.
- If I go quiet, I’m probably thinking — feel free to nudge.
- If my feedback misses the mark, tell me. I’m always learning.

🧪 Strengths
- I simplify complexity without dumbing things down.
- I bridge the gap between tech and business.
- I’m pragmatic but not afraid to challenge the status quo.
- I care about people, process, and product — in that order.

🐘 Weaknesses
- I can get too deep in the details — remind me to zoom out.
- I sometimes need a bit of time to process suggestion and critism due to RSD.
- I dislike inefficiency and may skip steps if they feel redundant.
- I get impatient with vague requirements — clarity is key.
